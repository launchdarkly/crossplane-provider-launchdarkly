        description: FeatureFlagEnvironment is the Schema for the FeatureFlagEnvironments
          API. Provides a LaunchDarkly environment-specific feature flag resource.
          This resource allows you to create and manage environment-specific feature
          flags attributes within your LaunchDarkly organization. Subsequent applies
          may overwrite the changes made by experiments and break your experiment.
          An alternate workaround is to use the lifecycle.ignore_changes https://developer.hashicorp.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
