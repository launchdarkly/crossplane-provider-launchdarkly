        description: AccessToken is the Schema for the AccessTokens API. Provides
          a LaunchDarkly access token resource. This resource allows you to create
          and manage access tokens within your LaunchDarkly organization. Be sure
          your state is configured securely before using this resource. See https://www.io/docs/state/sensitive-data.html
          for more details. The resource must contain either a "role", "custom_role"
          or an "inline_roles" (previously "policy_statements") block. As of v1.7.0,
          "policy_statements" has been deprecated in favor of "inline_roles".
